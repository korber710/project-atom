# Project Atom

Turn-based RPG by Korber Studios

# Background Lore

The world goes into WW3 and it is highly nuclear. The war wipes out most humans due to changes in the environment, some humans live above ground but the majority need to go underground. Over the next 25,000 years humanity undergos evolution on a hastened rate. Anything that survived above the ground was transformed into creatures that look like demons. Humans are able to wield 4 elemental powers. The powers come from nuclear crystals that were formed underground. Depending on the crystal they get different abilities. There are 4 clans with different powers, due to the different crystals.

1. Plutonic Winds
2. Radioactive Terraform
3. Atomic Combustion
4. Fusion Flow

The player character has the ability to combine the powers when they carry the crystals. Combining the powers in the game makes new elements and is used in the combat system. There will be a feature where you combine all 4 powers in the game and it will cause a special event where something catastrophic will happen (maybe a gate opens?). This will be the main plot or maybe a side plot.

# Gameplay

Turn-based combat system with a basic overworld. The game is not overly focused on being open, more on the main quest. There should be an AP system where characters will need skill points to be able to combine specific elemental types. Combining elements will raise thr players radiation level. At the end of the game, if the player as a specific raditation level there will be different endings.
